1) In Makefile select one of TEST_1, TEST_2, etc in CPPFLAGS
2) Compile and run. Info about the equation solved appear on screen, solution
is saved in solution_<#test>.txt
3) Run check_solutions.m in Matlab to see a plot of exact and computed solution

To add new tests:
1) In utils.hpp add a new EquationFunction
2) In main.cpp set final time, intial condition and integration step
