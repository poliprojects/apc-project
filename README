INSTRUCTIONS:

i)    Compile typing make

ii)   Run main providing the following parameters:
      1) test number [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
      2) solver identification code [ FE, adapFE, RK ]
      and optionally:
      3) initial step [ any double, default set to 0.1 ]
      4) tolerance [ any double, default set to 0.01 ]

      Info about the equation solved appear on screen
      Solution and time instants saved in solution_<#test>_<method>.txt

iii)  Run check_solutions.m in Matlab selecting the number of the test
      to see a plot of exact and computed solution

To add new tests:
1) In utils.hpp and utils.cpp add a new EquationFunction
2) In main.cpp ...
